title: Voyeurism and your dotfiles
layout: post
---

I'm a little bit obsessed with dotfiles. I like looking at your dotfiles. I
find it fascinating being able to get an insight in to how you work and to some
degree how your brain works. Github is overflowing with people's configuration
files. If you search Github for [dotfiles][] there are over 100 pages of
results from the likes of [Ryan Bates][], [Mislav Marohnić][], and
[me](http://github.com/jcf/dotfiles).

## Origins

I started my dotfiles based upon Ryan Bates' setup because I liked his simple
use of `rake` to soft link configuration files. Soft-linking your dotfiles
means updates are instantaneous and all your files hang around in an
encapsulated location readily available via a
[`cdot`](http://github.com/jcf/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/aliases#L6) command.

I ended up refactoring the installer to use a more object-orientated approach
to linking files and even had my 'new improved' rake task read my Github token
but the more I looked at it the more I thought it was an overengineered
solution to an incredibly simple problem.

Luckily I stumbled upon [Mislav Marohnić][]'s dotfiles and in it found an
[installer](http://errtheblog.com/posts/89-huba-huba) created by [Chris
Wanstrath][]. It's ultra-simple and very easy to work with, which is why I fell
in love with it!

## Features

My [dotfiles][] include a load of ZSH configuration files, which add useful
aliases for git and support RVM and Ruby on Rails development as well as
including the best Vim plugins I've found in the few years I've been hacking
with Vim.

### git

I've borrowed, written and stolen a lot of `git` aliases and scripts from all
over the place in the last few years. I've listed some interesting tidbits
below.

- `git last` Prints the last commit
- `git db` Delete a local and remote branch in one command
- `git lg` Print a list of commits with relative commit dates

And there are loads more, which can be found in my
[gitconfig](http://github.com/jcf/dotfiles/blob/master/gitconfig).

### zsh

I always use Z-Shell. I love it and wouldn't want to have to switch back to use
Bash. I love the brilliant completion system, the fantastic globbing support
and mind-boggling filtering available right on the command-line.

    <img src="/images/zsh-shot.png" title="ZSH shot"></img>
  </a>
</div>

You might notice I've got custom window and tab titles, a mini left-hand prompt
and although you can't see it above I have a right-hand prompt that includes
the current git branch (visit the full-size image and you'll see the right-hand
prompt).

I use a lot of aliases including `gs` which is an alias for `git status -sb`.
Something I like because it's succinct and only shows me what I need to know.

I also have global aliases for grepping and lessing output, which I've pasted
below.

{% highlight sh %}
A='|ack'
G='|grep'
H='|head'
L='|less'
N='&>/dev/null&'
T='|tail'
W='|wc'
{% endhighlight %}

As far as I'm aware this is a feature not available in Bash, although I might
be wrong.

<h3>Ruby <span class="alt">&</span> IRB</h3>

My [irbrc][] has a few useful methods and tricks that might be of interest. I'm
a particular fan of my cutdown version of Giles Bowkett's work to launch vim
from IRB in order to ease editing longer bits of Ruby.

There's a nicely wrapped up
[interactive_editor](http://github.com/jberkel/interactive_editor) gem you
might be interested in using if you decide you want the same behaviour but with
multiple editor support.

I stole `quick` from Evan Phoenix I think. It was definitely one of the
Rubinius guys.

{% highlight ruby %}
def quick(repetitions = 100, &block)
  require 'benchmark'
  Benchmark.bmbm do |b|
    b.report { repetitions.times(&block) }
  end
  nil
end

quick(1000) { 'string' << ' two three' }
quick(1000) { 'string' + ' two three' }
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion

There are a lot more customisations I use daily and I haven't even touched on
what I've done to vim via my [dotfiles][]; that's for another day.

Feel free to email me or send me a message through Github if you like something
in my [dotfiles][], notice a problem or have something to contribute.
